## üìñ Overview

This repository contains the analysis and findings for the project, "Analysis of Colon Cancer Survival Data: Treatment Efficacy and Subgroup Identification." The primary goal of this analysis is to explore a colon cancer dataset to understand the effectiveness of different treatments on patient survival.

The project employs several key statistical methods to not only compare treatment arms but also to identify specific patient subgroups that may respond differently to therapy. The full, reproducible analysis is documented in the R Markdown file.

## üìä Key Analyses & Methods

The following statistical methods were central to this analysis:

* **Kaplan-Meier Analysis:** To estimate and visualize survival curves.
* **Log-Rank Test:** To formally test for significant differences in survival distributions.
* **Cox Proportional Hazards Models:** To perform multivariate survival analysis, assessing the impact of treatments while controlling for other important covariates.
* **Subgroup Analysis:** To investigate treatment effects within specific patient strata.

    cd your-repository-name
    ```

2.  **Prerequisites:**
    * Ensure you have [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio Desktop](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) installed.
    * Install the necessary R packages by running this command in your R console:
        ```R
        install.packages(c("survival", "survminer", "ggplot2", "dplyr"))
        ```

3.  **Run the Analysis:**
    * Open the `analysis.Rmd` file in RStudio.
    * Click the "Knit" button to execute the code and regenerate the `Treatment-Efficacy.html` report.
